changes I made:
1 - It was a mistake to calculate the hours first then then the minutes. so i prioritized the minutes loop first.
    (gonna establish the hours baseline based on the starting hours + the hours output after caluclating the minutes)
2 - I sit the min counter to the start minute before the loop even starts. therefore avoided having to mess with it each time the loop runs!
3 - I simply added a minute each time the loop runs, if it passes 59 minutes (meaning 60)::
        - simply subtract 60 out of the total mins number
        - add 1 hour to the total hours
